Finds where vessels anchor, names those places, and derives the port visits and voyages vessels
make between them -- from vessel position data, AIS or VMS.

## Introduction

<div align="justify">

Global Fishing Watch processes billions of AIS position messages to track vessel activity at
sea. [[1]](#1) A large share of that activity isn't *at* sea at all: vessels spend much of their
time stopped near the coast -- at a port, an anchorage, a transshipment point -- before heading
back out. Knowing *where* those stops happen, *what* that place is called, and *when* a vessel
entered and left it is the basis for a wide range of downstream analysis: port-call statistics,
fishing-access agreements, labor and IUU-fishing risk assessments, and more.

`pipe-anchorages` answers those questions. It clusters stationary vessel positions near the coast
into candidate anchorage points, assigns each one a human-readable name, and then re-walks each
vessel's full track against those named anchorages to detect port-visit entry/exit events and the
voyages between them. The clustering thresholds, naming priority, and entry/exit/stop-speed rules
this repository implements are the same ones GFW publishes as its own methodology for this
dataset. [[2]](#2) [[3]](#3)

The anchorage clustering and naming stages (`anchorage-points`/`named-anchorages`) are run
manually/occasionally, against AIS position data. The port-visit detection chain
(`transition-messages`/`port-visits`/`confidence-voyages`) and `anchorages-visited-info`, though,
run in production *daily* against both AIS and VMS vessel tracks, reusing the same named-anchorages
reference table either way.

</div>

## How it works

<div align="justify">

The pipeline is a chain of five stages, each its own CLI command (see [Usage](#usage)), plus one
side stage that cross-references the results against other GFW pipelines' event data:

</div>

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    AP["anchorage-points<br/>cluster stationary positions"]
    NA["named-anchorages<br/>assign names"]
    TM["transition-messages<br/>flag candidate port transitions"]
    PV["port-visits<br/>resolve entry/exit events"]
    CV["confidence-voyages<br/>group visits into voyages"]
    AVI["anchorages-visited-info<br/>cross-reference other event types"]
    LOI[("loitering events<br/>(pipe-loitering)")]
    ENC[("encounter events<br/>(pipe-encounters)")]
    GAP[("gap events<br/>(pipe-gaps)")]

    AP --> NA --> TM --> PV --> CV

    LOI --> AVI

```

<div align="justify">

- **`anchorage-points`** clusters stationary AIS positions near the coast into candidate anchorage
  points -- a purely behavioral/geometric entity (an S2-cell cluster where enough distinct vessels
  sat still for long enough), independent of any port database. An anchorage exists whether or not
  it's near a known port.
- **`named-anchorages`** assigns each anchorage point a human-readable name, by nearest-match
  lookup against reference port and place gazetteers, with a manually-curated override list
  (corrections, forced removals) taking priority over the automated lookup.
- **`transition-messages`** flags candidate state transitions -- entering/exiting a named anchorage,
  stopping/starting to move within one -- from raw position messages, processed in bounded
  per-segment/per-day windows. Because it only sees one window at a time, it conservatively keeps
  ambiguous boundary records rather than discarding them.
- **`port-visits`** re-processes those candidate transitions against each vessel's *complete* track
  history, resolving the boundary cases `transition-messages` couldn't and assembling the final
  port-visit entry/exit events.
- **`confidence-voyages`** groups consecutive port visits into voyages -- the span between one
  visit's end and the next visit's start -- at a configurable minimum confidence level.
- **`anchorages-visited-info`** is independent of that chain: it cross-references the named
  anchorages dataset against loitering ([pipe-loitering]), encounter ([pipe-encounters]), and
  gap ([pipe-gaps]) events, producing a reference table of boolean presence indicators per
  anchorage.

</div>

## Development

<div align="justify">

This repository follows the conventions documented in [pipe-docs] (GFW's shared documentation hub
for pipeline repositories). First, clone the repository:

</div>

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/pipe-anchorages.git
```

<div align="justify">

Then see [preparing the development environment] and [git workflow] in [pipe-docs] for the rest --
Docker setup, installing dependencies, pre-commit hooks, and how branches/PRs are managed.

This repository's CLI and Apache Beam pipeline infrastructure are built on [gfw-common].

Once your environment is set up, the [Makefile] in this repository exposes the usual targets:
`make docker-build`, `make docker-shell`, `make test`, `make format`, `make lint`, among others --
run `make help` for the full list. No repository-specific system dependency is required beyond
what [pipe-docs] already covers.

</div>

## Usage

### Using the CLI

<div align="justify">

`pipe-anchorages`'s CLI covers every stage of the pipeline. Run `pipe-anchorages -h` for the
authoritative, up-to-date list, or `pipe-anchorages <command> -h` for a command's own parameters.

</div>

<table>
<tr>
<th width="1%" nowrap>Command</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="1%" nowrap><code>anchorage&#8209;points</code></td>
<td>Clusters stationary vessel positions near the coast into candidate (unnamed) anchorage
points.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="1%" nowrap><code>named&#8209;anchorages</code></td>
<td>Assigns names to anchorage points, from a reference port/place gazetteer and a manual
override list.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="1%" nowrap><code>transition&#8209;messages</code></td>
<td>Flags candidate port-related state transitions from raw position messages near named
anchorages.</td>

<td width="1%" nowrap><code>anchorages&#8209;visited&#8209;info</code></td>
<td>Cross-references named anchorages against loitering/encounter/gap events into a boolean
presence-indicator table.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div align="justify">

Example:

</div>

```shell
pipe-anchorages anchorage-points \
    --bq-in-messages world-fishing-827.pipe_production_v20201001.position_messages_ \
    --bq-in-segments world-fishing-827.pipe_production_v20201001.segments_ \
    --bq-out-anchorage-points world-fishing-827.scratch_ttl30d.anchorage_points \
    --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-01-31 \
    --gcs-in-fishing-ssvids gs://machine-learning-dev-ttl-120d/fishing_mmsi.txt
```

### Config files

<div align="justify">

Besides plain CLI flags, every command also accepts a config file via the built-in `-c`/
`--config-file` flag (YAML or JSON), with CLI flags taking precedence over matching config-file
keys. A runnable example for each command lives under `config/<command-name>/`, e.g.
[config/anchorage-points/bq-1-month.yaml](config/anchorage-points/bq-1-month.yaml) -- use these
as a starting point rather than hand-writing one from scratch.

```shell
pipe-anchorages anchorage-points -c config/anchorage-points/bq-1-month.yaml
```
