This folder contains the anchorage lists for VMS provided by analysts, often coming from the country itself. 
These files were parsed in notebooks/vms/parse_country_overrides.py to generate src/pipe_anchorages/data/port_lists/{country_name}_vms_reviewed_anchorages.csv
During parsing, issues such as duplicates are solved.
