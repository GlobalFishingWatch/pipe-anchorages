DESCRIPTION = """\
Selects, from all position messages in the date range, the subset that
port-visits needs to detect port visits. A position is kept if it is:

  * on either side of a candidate port state transition: entering or exiting
    port, or stopping or starting to move while in port, where "in port" means
    within a distance threshold of the nearest named anchorage;
  * on either side of a tracking gap;
  * the first or last position of a segment-day.

Each output row is one of those positions (a position message enriched with
the nearest anchorage), not a transition or an event: transitions are implied
by consecutive rows, and this is an intermediate step, not a finished product.

This command processes positions in bounded windows (currently per segment,
per day), so it can't always tell on its own whether a transition or a gap
happened at the edge of its window -- it conservatively keeps the boundary
positions either way. port-visits, which groups each vessel's positions across
all its segments and days in the processed range, resolves those cases and
builds the actual port events (PORT_ENTRY, PORT_EXIT, ...) and visits.

Besides the arguments defined here, you can also pass any pipeline option
defined for Apache Beam PipelineOptions class. For more information, see
    https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/reference/pipeline-options#python.\n
